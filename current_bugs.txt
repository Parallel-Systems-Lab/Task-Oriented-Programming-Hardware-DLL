scheduler :
hardware task support added to topaz- acts as duplicable task (can allocate few copies of hardware task)
                                       needs support at scheduler via hardware dll API -> out of scope for you.




3. [@+-k] start or finish doesnt work as should 
--> still buggy : (004) 
            @3 iteration is 4 iterations
             i think the window is reversed :
             A(init/fu)
             B(A[@3]/f)
       A will not run all its iterations while he has no dependencies with B.
       --check
       also i have explained it properly in the book.
    ->make sure we set the right examples and explane them correctly in the book (@-+k/ f or s , on one task or both tasks) 

4. no {k,m} group support - 
->topaz has the ability to id the syntex now (see logs) ,need to edit table accordingly (replaces set_group)                                                                         
->the code does not support it. it supports A(B[g]) with SetGroupSize function. // this is {g,1} with 1 as a const //easy enough to fix
--> fixed set_group data transactions
-->not sure which is k and whick is m 
-> still buggy.

--check. there is a minor problem because i released both of the tasks to do their initial group sizes, so the run in 2k/2m groups. but the functionality is right, and if you want to i can decude which one will run first and lock the other one.

future support :
4. rt_tick and rt_tock functions are available - should be more accurate -need to match Hrz to epiphany for same scale data - profiler will need parameter adjusting  

profiler:
1. some of the 000-006 examples does not display correctly
